<h1><img src="images/explosion.gif" width=150px height=70px>Welcome to my website!<img src="images/explosion.gif" width=150px height=70px></h1>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by to my little corner of my ass, so to speak :P</p>

<h2> About me </h2>
<p>To be honest, I'ts hard to say anything about who I am. I'm really indecisive on what exactly my goal is in life, and I get wrapped up in existential stuff when I try to think about it. I'm trying to get into game development, but im scared I wont have enough motivation to work as hard as everyone else does because, like i said, existential stuff. and also laziness i guess.
<p>I have a bunch of stuff im interested in , mostly just fiction and hobbies. of which ill list here:</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>
<p>ENA, Touhou, Homestuck, Undertale, Deltarune, Serial Experiments Lain, Yume Nikki, Soul Eater, Steven Universe</p>

<h3>Fiction I'm Not Crazy About But Still Like</h3>
<p><del>Ranfren</del> Epithet Erased</p>


<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>animation, music, drawing, coding, gaming, writing, voice acting (im a real fanby if you couldn't tell)</p>

<h2>Why'd I Make This?</h2>
<p>Theres a few reasons, one being that I wanted to learn how to code (though acted on it really late) and thought this would be a good excersize going into it (even theough coding is <i>WAY</i> more complex than HTML im pretty sure) </p>
<p>It also feels kinda freeing to have my own space on the web. I see a lot of people have a lot of trouble with big social media sites and their several toxic users and their stupid unfair rules, and i like the idea of how the internet used to work, with people making their own funny little websites and making their own funny little rules, albeit chaotic as all hell.</p>
